# lab-jump-point-search

Lab "Efficient Algorithms for Selected Problems" in summer term 2016 for University of Bonn.

We implemented and visualized the algorithm Jump Point Search. This algorithm is used for finding the shortest path in grid graphs.
The algorithm was presented first by Harabor and Grastien in papers "Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding on Grid Maps" and "Improving Jump Point Search".
Further we implemented improvements to the algorithm, namely bouding boxes, by S. Rabin and N. Sturtevant by paper "Combining Bounding Boxes and JPS to Prune Grid Pathfinding".
